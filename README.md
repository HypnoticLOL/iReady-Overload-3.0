# iReady-Overload-3.0
Credit to ArjhanToteck for being the original creator of iReady Overload and for helping me with the new and as far as im aware only version of iReady Overload. Unlike previous owners of the title iReady Overload this will have no licence and be 100% open source. This may change depending on the outcome of the iReady developers.
